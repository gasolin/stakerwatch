### Get ETH2 staking stats

```sh
$ npx staker stats

101151 ETH has been deposited for 3160 validators
[▓▓▓▓▓▓░░░░░░░░░░░░░░░░░░░░░░░░] 19.29%
```

### Get ETH2 validator summary (from multiple beacon explorer)

Via [beaconscan](https://beaconscan.com/)

```sh
$ npx staker beaconscan [address or index]

Check [address or index] via beaconscan(medalla)
```

Via [beaconcha.in](https://www.beaconcha.in/)
```sh
$ npx staker beaconchain [address or index]

Check [address or index] via beaconcha.in(medalla)
```

### Observe ETH Address or Contract (from multiple explorer)

Given a ETH address and get related live stats (Balance)

```sh
$ npx staker balance [addr]

The Address has 1 ETH
```

Given a ETH address and open the browser to search address on [Etherscan](https://etherscan.io/)

```sh
$ npx staker etherscan [addr]

(open browser to search [addr] on etherscan)
```

Given a ETH address and open the browser to search address on [BitQuery](https://explorer.bitquery.io)

```sh
$ npx staker bitquery [addr]

(open browser to search [addr] on explorer.bitquery.io)
```

Given a ETH address and open the browser to search address on [Blockchair](https://blockchair.com/ethereum)

```sh
$ npx staker blockchair [addr]

(open browser to search [addr] on blockchair)
```

Given a ETH address and open the browser to search address on [Bloxy](https://bloxy.info/)

```sh
$ npx staker bloxy [addr]

(open browser to search [addr] on bloxy.info)
```

Given any text (ex a ETH address) and get the QRCode

```sh
$ npx staker qrcode [addr]

(QRcode shows here)
```

### Get current Gas Fee (from multiple sources)

```sh
$ npx staker gasfee

Current on-chain gas fee is 48 gwei
```

```sh
$ npx staker gasnow

Current gas fee (report by gasnow) is H:70 M:50 L:48 gwei
```

```sh
$ npx staker gasstation

Current gas fee (report by gasstation) is H:90 M:70 L:60 gwei
```

```sh
$ npx staker gastracker

Current gas fee (report by etherscan) is H:90 M:70 L:60 gwei
```

# Configuable options

### Show result in different languages

Currently support `en`(english) and `zh_TW` (Traditional Chinese)

Set the `SAIHUBOT_LANG` environment variable

```
export SAIHUBOT_LANG=zh_TW
```

Then run the command.

### Use specified Ethereum Node

Set `SAIHUBOT_NODE_URL` to the node you want to use, ex: infura, or pick from https://ethereumnodes.com/

### Pre-define Ethereum Address

do `export SAIHUBOT_ETH_ADDR=0x.....` and you can use balance command without pass the address

```sh
npx staker balance

The Address has 1 ETH
```

### Pre-define Validator Address

do `export SAIHUBOT_ETH_VALIDATOR=12345` and you can use `beaconchain` or `beaconscan` command without pass the address

```sh
npx staker beaconchain

Check 12345 via beaconchain
```
